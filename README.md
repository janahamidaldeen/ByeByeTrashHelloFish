Language & Tools: Python, Tkinter
Theme: Environmental awareness through interactive gameplay

Project Description: 
This project is a simple 2D arcade-style game where the player controls a boat equipped with a hook to clean up ocean waste. The goal is to collect as much trash (plastic and cans) as possible while avoiding catching fish, all within a set time limit.

Gameplay Highlights:
The hook drops and retracts with the spacebar.
Trash and fish move horizontally across the ocean at varying speeds.
Points are awarded for collecting waste (plastic earns more than cans).
Points are deducted for accidentally catching fish.
A countdown timer ends the game, followed by a results screen.

Features Implemented:
Sprite animation and collision detection
Timer and scoring logic
Difficulty levels
Basic environmental education through gameplay

This game was built to demonstrate core programming concepts (event handling, object-oriented design, GUI development) while promoting ocean conservation.
